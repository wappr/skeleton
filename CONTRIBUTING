# how to contribute

This project is still in early stages of development and any contributions are
welcome. I'm open to suggestions on how things are approached as well as what
all should be included. There are no tests at the time of writing this, so maybe
that could be something you start.

You can find us(me) on [Wappr's Gitter](https://gitter.im/wappr-php/skeleton) if you have
any questions.

## submitting changes

Please create an issue, fork the repo, make your changes, and submit a pull
request that mentions the issue. I usually like to include the issue number in
my commit messages, but that is ultimately your decision.

## coding conventions

At this stage of the project, contributions are more important than coding
conventions. I usually use `php-cs-fixer` to style my code.
